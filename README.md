The project encompasses the manipulation of an RDBMS (MS Access) through the use of SQL as well as data visualization / creating a hierarchical form within MS Access. The subject matter is specifically fine/famous historical artists over several important historical artistic movements. I was able to generate conclusive insights based off of my queries, notably with regard to the artworks, artists, and their associated artistic movements.
